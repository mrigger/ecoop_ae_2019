\emph{Aims and Scope}\newline
The Dagstuhl Artifacts Series (DARTS) publishes evaluated research data and artifacts in all areas of computer science. An artifact can be any kind of content related to computer science research, e.g., experimental data, source code, virtual machines containing a complete setup, test suites, or tools.

% What are the goals?
The \emph{Artifact Evaluation Committee} (AEC) reviews software artifacts, data sets, and proofs that accompany research papers published at ECOOP.
The goals of the \emph{Artifact Evaluation} (AE) are to ensure that the reviewed artifacts are reproducible, well-documented, and closely correspond to the associated paper.
The accepted artifacts are archived in the \emph{Dagstuhl Artifacts Series} (DARTS) published on the \emph{Dagstuhl Research Online Publication Server} (DROPS).
Each artifact is assigned a \emph{Digital Object Identifier (DOI)} that can be used in future citations.

% what is the process?
The AE process for 2019 was a continuation of the AE process of previous ECOOP editions.
In particular, the process was still based on the artifact evaluation guidelines by Shriram Krishnamurthi, Matthias Hauswirth, Steve Blackburn, and Jan Vitek published on the Artifact Evaluation site.\footnote{\url{http://www.artifact-eval.org}}
The guidelines for artifacts that contain mechanized proofs developed by the ECOOP 2018 AEC  were also reused to help both reviewers and authors in creating and reviewing such artifacts.

% what is the outcome?
This year, the committee evaluated 16 artifacts, which correspond to 57\% of all accepted papers. % total: 28 accepted papers
14 of the artifacts were accepted (a 88\% acceptance rate).
In total, 50\% of the research
papers published at ECOOP 2018 have successfully passed the AE process, indicated by an artifact-evaluation badge.
This outcome is similar to the outcomes of previous ECOOP editions; in 2018, 38\% of the research papers, and in 2017, 59\% of the research papers were accompanied by accepted artifacts.

We would like to thank the 19 members of this year's AEC, who donated their valuable time and effort to make the AE process possible.
We would also like to thank Michael Wagner for the publication of the artifacts volume, and the Program Chair Alastair Donaldson for helping us coordinate the artifact evaluation with the paper review process.

\chapter{Artifact Evaluation Process}

The authors of all papers that were accepted to ECOOP 2019 had the option to submit an artifact with their paper, irrespective of the paper category (i.e., Research, Tool Insights, Reproduction Study, Experience Report, Pearl, and Brave New Idea).
Each artifact was evaluated by three reviewers who were part of the AEC.
The reviewing process consisted of two phases.
In the ``kick-the-tires'' phase, reviewers briefly verified the basic integrity, documentation, and set-up of the artifacts.
In case of any issues, reviewers had the opportunity to ask clarifying questions to the authors.
Authors, in turn, could respond to the reviewers' first feedback, and provide missing documentation or small fixes to the artifacts, to ensure that reviewers were able to fully evaluate the artifacts.
In the second phase, each reviewer had three weeks to do a comprehensive evaluation of the two to three artifacts they were assigned to review.
This included assessing whether an artifact fully corresponded to the paper, whether all results presented in the paper could be reproduced, how well the artifact was documented, and how easy it would be to re-use the artifact in future research.
The review phase was then followed by a discussion phase, in which artifacts were discussed to converge on either the artifacts' acceptance or rejection.
Authors that received an acceptance notification were given one week of time to incorporate reviewers' feedback and submit the camera-ready version of their artifacts.
