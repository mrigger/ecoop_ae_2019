\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Developing interactive applications (apps) against event-driven software frameworks such as Android is notoriously difficult.
To create apps that behave as expected, developers must follow complex and often implicit \emph{asynchronous programming protocols}.
Such protocols intertwine the proper registering of callbacks to receive control from the framework with appropriate application-programming interface (API) calls that in turn affect the set of possible future callbacks.
An app violates
the protocol
when, for example, it calls a particular API method in a state of the framework where such a call is invalid.
What makes
automated reasoning hard in this domain is
largely what makes programming apps against such frameworks hard: the
specification of the protocol is unclear, and the control flow is complex, asynchronous, and higher-order.
In this paper, we tackle the problem of specifying and modeling
event-driven application-programming protocols.
In particular, we formalize a core meta-model that captures the
dialogue between event-driven frameworks and application callbacks.
Based on this
meta-model, we define a language called \emph{lifestate} that permits precise and formal descriptions of 
application-programming protocols and the callback control flow
imposed by the event-driven framework.
Lifestate unifies modeling what app callbacks can expect of the framework with specifying rules the app must respect when calling into the framework. 
In this way, we effectively combine lifecycle constraints and typestate rules.
To evaluate the effectiveness of lifestate modeling,
we provide a dynamic verification algorithm that takes as input a trace of execution of an app and a lifestate protocol specification to either produce a trace witnessing a protocol violation or a proof that no such trace is realizable.

% ARTIFACT: section on the scope of the artifact (what claims of the paper are intended to be backed by this artifact?)
\begin{scope}
The accompanying scholarly paper~\cite{vervita-paper} argues for a re-examination of the process of modeling callback control flow. Through this process, we identified some essential aspects of event-driven frameworks to arrive at a language called \emph{lifestates} that simultaneously captures callback control flow and event-driven application-programming protocols at the app-framework interface. This re-examination leads to both a methodology for empirically validating such event-driven framework models against corpora of app-framework interaction traces and a technique for verifying trace rearrangements are absent of protocol violations. Overall, we evaluate empirically the capacity of lifestates to model a real, complex event-driven framework like Android and the necessity of validating such models (cf. Section~6 of the accompanying paper~\cite{vervita-paper}).
This artifact includes the software and inputs that we used in the evaluation section of our paper.
